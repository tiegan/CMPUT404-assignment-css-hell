          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a 4th year student at the University of Alberta. After graduating Ardrossan Junior Senior High School with a 90% average, I spent my first two years at the University of Alberta working towards a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Statistics. During this time, I had taken a couple of Computing Science courses and I enjoyed it much more than what I was doing. After the Winter 2015 term, I changed my focus and am now working towards a Bachelor of Science Specializing in Computing Science. With a GPA of 3.5 through 33 courses, and 3.6 from 12 CMPUT courses, I make sure I work hard in order to try and attain the highest marks I can and so far I've been able to demonstrate it.</p>
         <p>I will graduate in December 2017 and hope to have a full-time job soon thereafter. My dream job would be something that could combine my passion for Computing Science and hockey, given the fact the advanced analytics community has grown over the past few years, making the use of languages such as Python to help scrape and generate data and even visualize it, which means that area is open for people with my skills and passion.</p>
